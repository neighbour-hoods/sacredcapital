# Technical Architecture

The Reputation Vault infrastructure is being built by the Economikit Alliance on Holochain's recently released RSM version. One of the key reasons for building on Holochain is its emphasis on contextual validation, which is critical for the relativistic view of reputation that we foster.

In Holochain terminology, the Vault is a hApp bundle, with a collection of DNAs as zomes - which are articulated in the modules below. More details will be published soon.
