# Sacred Capital

Distributed networks operate without the benefits of overarching consensus or legal systems. Formally articulated, agent-centric reputation systems help communities and individuals discover and interact with each other in such environments. 

Sacred Capital is building modular infrastructure that allows micro-communities, [Neighbourhoods](https://app.gitbook.com/@sacred-capital/s/neighbourhoods), apps and networks to drive whole new dimensions of engagement for their members.

At the heart of our infrastructure is the Reputation Vault, a suite of libraries, micro-services and a formal language for cultural articulation. The first implementation of the Reputation Vault is on Holochain's agent-centric fabric because of its emphasis on contextual validation.

The Reputation Vault serves two primary functions: 

a. Enables micro-networks of people to articulate their culture formally and for agents to discover one another on the basis of this cultural articulation. And; 

b. Allows agents to port their reputation data into other contexts, and in doing so generate network effects for reputation.

_In the long run, we hope this may facilitate new kinds of social orchestration through the construction of 'Neighbourhoods'._ 

The Reputation Vault is built out as a collection of the following modules:

**1. Reputation Libraries**

Reputation Data represents the most fundamental building blocks of our reputation system. To facilitate computations with and access to these building blocks, we package them as pluggable, swappable libraries that allow communities to articulate and iterate on their culture with ease. Such structures also allow for computation on reputation data across contexts. 

#### 2. The Reputation Interchange

The interchange co-ordinates cross-membrane access to reputation data through a consent driven process. In other words, a neighbourhood, or micro-community can articulate their culture using reputation data that is being generated across other neighbourhoods as well as their own.

From an agent's perspective the interchange serves as a _switchboard_ that allows them to control their reputation data as they hop across micro-collectives. More details about the process, and the channels that data is ported through are outlined in subsequent sections.

**3. Reputation Scores**

Reputation data from across contexts is computed within a neighbourhood to generate what is known as a 'Reputation Score'. Reputation scores are calculated locally, in a specific neighbourhood, which means they are contextual, and not universally imposed as absolute snapshots of reality. 

Sacred Capital's DSL facilitates easy articulation of scores to empower collectives to modulate their internal culture.
