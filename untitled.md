# Porting Reputation through Memetic Bridges

Memetic Bridges allow people to show up in a new ecosystem, network, or community with Reputation data they may have earned in other contexts. Through the Propose-Consent mechanism explained in previous sections, one neighbourhood may generate Reputation Scores about a user's data from multiple sources. 

Moreover, using memetic bridges to co-ordinate information between different neighbourhoods provides interesting contrasts to the traditional blockchain-style approach of universal consensus. Trust in this case remains a human problem. Further, not all interactions are monetarily critical - some can be contextual relevant, and memetic bridges lean into the latter.

Why memetic bridges:

* Consensus is expensive and monolithic, and therefore tends to lean towards one-dimensional information transfer. 
* Consensus also involves a struggle \(either through governance or otherwise\) to be in a position to define the rules for what can be measured and what cannot. In other words, there can be a socio-cultural loss in defining what is important, which is then driven top-down.
* Leans into Perspectivism

A memetic bridge is established when a Neighbourhood 'trusts' a specific set of members to access reputation data from another Neighbourhood. Of course, it is critical for these members to have access to this other Neighbourhood. Trust, therefore, remains a human question, and is not 'automated' away through distributed ledgers. Who the neighbourhood trusts - and for what information - defines the quality of the memetic bridge, and the veracity of the information that it delivers.

This document outlines the technical architecture for memetic bridges in agent-centric environments like Holochain:

Establishing bridges has far-reaching consequences:

1. Eventually developing a sense of sufficiency with reputational wealth: This occurs through contextual network effects for reputation that a user may have earned in one neighbourhood.
2. Reinforcing collaborative patterns between collectives: instead of just trade, new patterns can arise which are non-zero-sum in nature. Large scale global problems can be attempted using a vast network of memetic bridges.
