# Porting Reputation through Memetic Bridges

Memetic Bridges allow people to show up in a new ecosystem, network, or community with Reputation data they may have earned in other contexts. Through the Propose-Consent mechanism explained in previous sections, one neighbourhood may generate Reputation Scores about a user's data from multiple sources. 

Moreover, using memetic bridges to co-ordinate information between different neighbourhoods provides interesting contrasts to the traditional blockchain-style approach of universal consensus. Trust in this case remains a human problem. More over, not all interactions are monetary critcial, some can be contextual relevant, and memetic bridges lean into the latter. 

Why memetic bridges:

* Consensus is expensive and monolithic, and therefore tends to lean towards one-dimensional information transfer. 
* Consensus also involves a struggle \(either through governance or otherwise\) to be in a position to define the rules for what can be measured and what cannot. In other words, there can be a socio-cultural loss in defining what is important, which is then driven top-down.
* Leans into Perspectivism

A memetic bridge is established when a Neighbourhood 'trusts' a specific set of members to access reputation data from another Neighbourhood. Of course, it is critical for these members to have access to this other Neighbourhood. Trust, therefore, remains a human question, and is not 'automated' away through distributed ledgers. Who the neighbourhood trusts, and for what information defines the quality of the memetic bridge, and the veracity of the information that it delivers.

This document outlines the technical architecture for memetic bridges in agent-centric environments like Holochain: [https://hackmd.io/SggiWgmLQyuyFany\_y3pyw?both](https://hackmd.io/SggiWgmLQyuyFany_y3pyw?both)

Establishing bridges has far-reaching consequences:

1. Eventually developing a sense of sufficiency with reputational wealth: This occurs through contextual network effects for reputation that a user may have earned in one neighbourhood.
2. Reinforcing collaborative patterns between collectives: instead of them just being trade, they can now be non-zero-sum in nature. Large scale global problems can be attempted using a vast network of memetic bridges.
